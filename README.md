###About Me

I've spent the last 15 years in the Operations and Facility Services industry, working as a vendor for enterprise level clients. My primary focus was to establish and develop process and build support teams through outsourced vendor relationships while delivering executive level reporting and metrics to illustrate productivity and efficiency.

Prior to that career I spent 2 years at DeVry University (before it was a university) studying Computer Science. I've always had a passion for technology, which has had a huge impact on my professional career. Keeping an eye on technology and how it may be applied to the professional world is something I thoroughly enjoy!
