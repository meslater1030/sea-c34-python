*Mary Dickson*

**Bio**
I recently left my job at UW to pursue a career in technology. Iâ€™ve been learning the basics of web development and data science and documenting the process at (http://www.marydickson.com). Really excited to grow with this awesome learning community.

Personal notes: I grew up in Maryland, moved to Houston after college through Teach For America and lived there for 10 years, and moved to Seattle in May 2013 when my partner got a job working for a local game company. Love coffee, theater, games, camping, cider. Just moved to Hillman City. Getting married in May!
