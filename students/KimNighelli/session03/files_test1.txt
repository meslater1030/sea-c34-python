# These are lyrics from CHVRCHES's Recover. I like this song. 

And if I recover
Will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over
Or we can just leave it here
So pick any number
Choose any color
I've got the answer
Open the envelope
I'll give you one more chance
To say we can change or part ways
And you take what you need
And you don't need me
