# Two questions

# what is something in the standard library that's object oriented?
a_string = "My name is Megan."
# a string is an object that has attributes and methods
print(a_string.count('a'))  # string has a built in method of count
print(len(a_string))  # string has a built in function of length

# How can use of object oriented programming help make programs more readable?
