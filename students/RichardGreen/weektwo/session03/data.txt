Note Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, there are several versions of this module in the standard library. The os.path module is always the path module suitable for the operating system Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths. However, you can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a path that is always in one of the different formats. They all have the same interface:
posixpath for UNIX-style paths
ntpath for Windows paths
macpath for old-style MacOS paths
os2emxpath for OS/2 EMX paths
