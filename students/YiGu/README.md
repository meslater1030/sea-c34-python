##Yi Gu

Hi, I am Yi. I am from Shenzhen, China. I came to the States 10 years ago. I got my Bachelor's degree from UW Civil Engineering department in 2012. I owe a Mac but I have been using Windows for school and work.  I don't know much about Linux. I am a little overwhelmed but I am also excited. Maybe I should of take the fundation I class.

I work as a Network Operation Center Lead for INRIX. INRIX is a software company focus on Traffic/Location Data and services. I work with testers and I owe deployment validation at work. I really enjoy my work but I know it's time to find out my next career move.  I am not 100% sure if I want to be a software developer. I hope I will get my answer after this class.

After work and class, I enjoy baby and cat videos ... I also like to travel, hike and camp.  You can often find me in a microbrew trying out new beers on the weekends.
